                  <b>Android Sideloader</b> is a simple tool that lets users <b>easily install</b> apps and games on their <b>android</b> device.
                  This project was developed with C#, uses ADB to communicate with the device, and RCLONE to download the apps and games.
                  <br>
                  Because android sideloader works with any android device, a lot of people started using it with their Oculus Quest devices
                  <br>
                  Around the version 1.6, the code started to be too messy to work on it in a timely manner and it was filled with bugs, because it was my first project, the code was very bad and didn't follow good programming practices.
                  After the 2.0 update, I was too burnt out to continue developing the project, I had to focus on exams, school and preparing for uni, I wanted to recode the sideloader with better code, from scratch, and making it cross-platform, but because of Uni, I never had the time.

               <b>'go evil'</b> is my biggest project at the time of writing this, it is a bundle of malware-like software, that will be used by pentesters to show how easy it is to "hack" insecure devices, and what you can do with access to a device.
               <br>At the moment it is very early in development, only having a working ransomware, but it will be updated with more features and more functionality.
               <br>Currently I'm working on its backend which will be complex having features like graphs of "victims" the pentester infected, a builder, and more features on a web panel.
               <br>Among the planned features are a stealer, a package for persistence and startup / hidden startup, which are more difficult to implement since this bundle is cross-platform between windows and linux platforms, and maybe Android, but that will be hard to do and will probably be done as the last feature.
               <br>At the moment of writing this, the ransomware is FUD (fully undetected) by anti-malware software, this probably won't be the case in the future when it will get more popular.

               Android Sideloader was one of my biggest projects, it all started when I got an Oculus Quest. The Oculus Quest is an Android based VR headset, I wanted to make a platform similar to F-Droid, where any person or company could make its/their own "config", and serve apps and games for the headset.
               <br> It started as just a simple exe file developers could share along with their app, but it got updated frequently, and every update added new features, like self-updating, installing an app with one click, downloading and installing games automatically, keeping track of the versions, showing games thumbnails and more.
               <br> Since it was my first big project, it taught me a lot, but the code was very messy, and very quickly it became very hard to work on. I wanted to recode it from scratch, and make it cross-platform since I switched to Linux, but didn't have the time because of school, the national exam, and after that, Uni.

               Even though the internship at Accesa only lasted 2 weeks, it was a great experience where I learnt a lot about the general IT working environment. We were taught basic RPA, the scrum methodology and we did a bit of coding practice in C# and JavaScript.
               <br>
               We met a lot of awesome and kind people, which didn't hesitate to answer our questions.
